# Eclipse Monkey Scripts #

Scripts for extending [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) and [Aptana](http://www.aptana.com/) functionalities through the Eclipse Monkey plugin.

If you want to learn more about Eclipse Monkey and how to use those scripts visit: <http://docs.aptana.com/docs/index.php/About_Eclipse_Monkey>.

## How to install Eclipse Monkey ##

Eclipse Monkey comes pre-installed with Aptana, but incase you don't have it just follow these steps:

1.	Go to the Eclipse plugin manager (Help -> Install New Software...)
2.	Type the address <http://download.eclipse.org/technology/dash/update/>.
3.	Select Eclipse Monkey from the list.
4.	Press "next" and "ok" until the installation ends.
5.	Restart Eclipse.

Now you should see a new item called "Scripts" on the Eclipse menu and also have a new view called "Scripts" (Window -> Show View -> Other... -> Scripts) and you are ready to start scripting.
